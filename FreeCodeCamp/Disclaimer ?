I have no idea what I'm doing :)
  These projects are symbolic of my development journey. I would like to add to them as I work on and complete them.
  I would LIKE to create documentation of my progress, challenges, and achievements - hopefully this will be come the kind of resource I was looking for (numbingly scrolled through github search filters for an entire night - literally)
  Will also hopefully add general Cybersec write ups/documentation, journal posts in the future when I am not running on Three hours of sleep.
